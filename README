This is  a modified Version of Flatz's Remote PKG Installer with The PS4 PKG Store integrated into it
It is fully customisable (All of the Files are stored in /data/store if you want to create or install a theme)
You can host your own Packages and use them with this by modifying and hosting the pkgs.json as well as the .pkg Files somewhere and then providing the URL of the json file in the Settings.

I recommend using https://sites.google.com/site/theleecherman/ps4pkgviewer by theleecherman to acquire the necessary information and Files from a .pkg file that you want to host. I might release a tool that makes this Process easier at some point

If you want to build it yourself you'll probably need to modify the Makefile because i used weird Paths for my Files and install make (i got it through chocolatey) as well as any other Stuff that is required for the remote PKG installer

If you messed something up, delete the /data/store Folder on your PS4 and then reinstall this App to regenerate the Folder
